# Angular 12 Registration and Login Form
This project is a simple registration and login form developed using Angular 12. It allows users to register a new account and authenticate themselves to log in to the system.

Features
1. User registration: Users can create a new account by providing their username, email address, and password. The registration form validates the input and displays appropriate error messages for any validation failures.
2. User login: Registered users can log in to the system using their email address and password. The login form verifies the credentials and grants access to authenticated users.
3. Form validation: Both the registration and login forms implement client-side form validation to ensure that the entered data meets the required criteria. Validation messages are displayed for invalid or missing input.

Technologies Used
1. Angular 12: The frontend of the application is developed using Angular 12, a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications.
2. TypeScript: Angular 12 uses TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, which enhances code maintainability and tooling support.
3. HTML/CSS: The user interface is created using HTML and styled with CSS to provide an intuitive and visually appealing experience.
